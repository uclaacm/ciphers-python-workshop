A collaboration workshop between ACM Cyber & ACM TeachLA focusing on implementing classical ciphers in Python! The workshop was taught to middle school students at Western Avenue Technology Magnet during the Spring 2022 Quarter.

## Slides
The sides from the workshop can be accessed [here](http://links.uclaacm.com/ciphers).

## Demos
The demos for the workshop involved showing Python string manipulation and conditionals in encoding and decoding a Caesar Cipher. The demos can be accessed [here](https://github.com/uclaacm/ciphers-python-workshop/demos).

## Project
The project the students implemented involved several Python functions that encoded and decoded a Caeser Cipher. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/uclaacm/ciphers-python-workshop/project).

## Authors
This workshop was developed as part of a collaboration between ACM Cyber and ACM TeachLA. All of the workshop contents, slides, demos, and project were developed by Salma Alandary and Benson Liu.
